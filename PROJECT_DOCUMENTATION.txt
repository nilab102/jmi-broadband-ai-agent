Project: AI-Powered Broadband Comparison Assistant with Voice and Text Interface

================================================================================
ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW
================================================================================

This project is a dual-mode conversational AI agent that helps users find and 
compare broadband deals in the UK. It supports both voice and text interactions 
and provides intelligent recommendations based on user requirements.

KEY ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS:
1. Dual-Agent Architecture (Voice + Text)
2. Modular Service-Based Design
3. Unified Conversation Tracking
4. Tool-Based Function Calling
5. Real-time WebSocket Communication

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. DUAL-AGENT ARCHITECTURE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The system employs TWO specialized agents, each optimized for different 
interaction modes:

A) VOICE AGENT (Pipecat Framework + Gemini Multimodal Live)
   - Framework: Pipecat (v0.0.73)
   - LLM: Google Gemini Multimodal Live API
   - Purpose: Real-time voice conversations with low latency
   - Features:
     * Native audio streaming (no intermediate STT/TTS needed)
     * Built-in VAD (Voice Activity Detection) using Silero
     * Ultra-low latency (~500ms response time)
     * Native function calling support
     * Pipeline-based architecture for audio processing
   
   WHY PIPECAT FOR VOICE?
   - Native audio streaming eliminates STT/TTS latency bottlenecks
   - Gemini Multimodal Live provides industry-leading voice quality
   - Pipeline architecture makes audio processing modular and extensible
   - Built-in WebSocket support for real-time communication
   - Event-driven design fits perfectly with async voice interactions

B) TEXT AGENT (LangChain Framework + Gemini Flash)
   - Framework: LangChain (v0.3.20)
   - LLM: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash
   - Purpose: Structured text conversations with memory
   - Features:
     * Conversation memory management (window buffer)
     * Tool calling via LangChain agents
     * Structured prompt engineering
     * Rich context management
     * Broadband-specific optimizations (caching, parameter tracking)
   
   WHY LANGCHAIN FOR TEXT?
   - Mature ecosystem for conversational AI
   - Built-in memory management (ConversationBufferWindowMemory)
   - Excellent tool integration and routing
   - Strong support for structured prompts and context
   - Easy to extend with custom tools and chains
   - Better for complex parameter extraction and validation

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. FRAMEWORK COMPARISON & SELECTION RATIONALE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PIPECAT vs LANGCHAIN:

Pipecat (Voice):
+ Specialized for voice/audio pipelines
+ Native audio streaming (no STT/TTS needed)
+ Ultra-low latency for voice interactions
+ Event-driven architecture for real-time processing
+ Pipeline composition for audio processing
- Limited text conversation features
- Newer framework with smaller community
- Less documentation for edge cases

LangChain (Text):
+ Mature framework with large community
+ Excellent memory and context management
+ Rich tooling ecosystem
+ Better for complex reasoning and multi-step tasks
+ Strong prompt engineering capabilities
+ Better debugging and introspection tools
- Higher latency (requires STT/TTS for voice)
- More complex setup for simple tasks
- Heavier dependency footprint

DECISION: Use both frameworks for their strengths
- Pipecat for voice: Leverages native audio for best UX
- LangChain for text: Provides robust conversation management

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. TRACING AND MONITORING (Langfuse)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Implemented comprehensive tracing and observability using Langfuse:

WHAT IS LANGFUSE?
An open-source LLM observability platform that provides:
- Conversation tracking and debugging
- Token usage monitoring
- Quality scoring and metrics
- Performance analytics

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
✓ Unified conversation tracking across voice and text agents
✓ Activity logging for all tool calls and LLM interactions
✓ Performance metrics (latency, token usage)
✓ Quality scoring based on response characteristics
✓ Session management with user and conversation IDs
✓ Detailed error tracking and debugging

TRACING ARCHITECTURE:
1. Conversation Manager creates unified session per user
2. Both agents share same trace ID for correlation
3. All activities logged to centralized trace
4. Quality scores calculated post-response
5. Insights extracted from conversation patterns

TRACED ACTIVITIES:
- System initialization
- User input (text/voice)
- LLM responses
- Tool/function calls
- Tool results
- Errors and exceptions
- Connection events

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. CHALLENGES ENCOUNTERED AND SOLUTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A) CHALLENGE: Duplicate Tool Definitions
   PROBLEM: AgentManager returned duplicate tools causing LangChain errors
   SOLUTION: Implemented deduplication logic in tool adapter creation
   LESSON: Always validate tool schemas before registration

B) CHALLENGE: Conversation Trace Correlation
   PROBLEM: Voice and text agents had separate traces, hard to correlate
   SOLUTION: Created unified ConversationManager with shared session IDs
   LESSON: Plan observability architecture from the start

C) CHALLENGE: Postcode Validation Latency
   PROBLEM: Fuzzy search on 1.7M postcodes was slow
   SOLUTION: Implemented caching layer + optimized search algorithm
   LESSON: Cache frequently accessed data with smart invalidation

D) CHALLENGE: WebSocket Message Duplication
   PROBLEM: Tool results sent twice (by tool and by agent)
   SOLUTION: Clarified responsibility - tools send structured data, 
             agent sends final natural language response separately
   LESSON: Clear interface contracts prevent redundancy

E) CHALLENGE: LangChain Tool Schema Conversion
   PROBLEM: Pipecat tool schemas incompatible with LangChain format
   SOLUTION: Built adapter layer with dynamic Pydantic model generation
   LESSON: Framework interop requires thoughtful abstraction layers

F) CHALLENGE: Gemini API Connection Stability
   PROBLEM: Occasional WebSocket timeouts and connection drops
   SOLUTION: Implemented retry logic with exponential backoff
   LESSON: External APIs need robust error handling and retries

G) CHALLENGE: Context Management Between Agents
   PROBLEM: Voice and text agents had separate conversation state
   SOLUTION: Shared broadband context manager with unified state
   LESSON: Stateful applications need centralized state management

H) CHALLENGE: Scraping Performance
   PROBLEM: Playwright scraping was slow (3-5 seconds)
   SOLUTION: Implemented async scraping + result caching
   LESSON: Scraping should be async and cached aggressively

- Router layer handles communication

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12. KEY METRICS AND PERFORMANCE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VOICE AGENT:
- Latency: ~500-800ms (speech to response)
- VAD stop detection: 1.2s silence
- Max concurrent connections: Not tested
- Memory per session: ~50-100MB

TEXT AGENT:
- Latency: ~1-3s (depends on tool calls)
- Memory window: 10 messages
- Max concurrent users: Not tested
- Cache hit rate: Not measured

SCRAPING:
- Average scrape time: 3-5s (no cache)
- Cache TTL: 30 minutes
- Success rate: ~95% (manual testing)

TRACING:
- Coverage: ~95% of operations
- Overhead: <50ms per operation

COST (Estimated per 1000 conversations):
- Gemini API: $5-15 (varies by conversation length)
- Database: ~$0.01
- Scraping: ~$0.05
- Hosting: Variable

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
13. DEPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Database connection pooling configured
- In-memory cache needs Redis for multi-instance

SECURITY:
- API keys in environment variables (not hardcoded)
- CORS configured for frontend origin
- No authentication implemented (TODO)
- No rate limiting (TODO)

MONITORING:
- Langfuse for conversation tracing
- Loguru for structured logging
- No metrics/alerting (TODO)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
14. LESSONS LEARNED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. CHOOSE THE RIGHT TOOL FOR THE JOB
   Using Pipecat for voice and LangChain for text leveraged each 
   framework's strengths instead of forcing one to do both.

2. OBSERVABILITY IS NOT OPTIONAL
   Implementing Langfuse early made debugging and optimization much easier.
   Wish I had added it from day 1.

3. SERVICE LAYER PAYS OFF
   Extracting business logic into services made code reusable across agents
   and easy to test in isolation.

4. CACHING IS CRITICAL FOR UX
   Smart caching reduced response times dramatically and made the system
   feel much faster.

5. FUZZY MATCHING SOLVES REAL PROBLEMS
   UK postcode fuzzy matching prevented 90% of "postcode not found" errors
   and improved UX significantly.

6. WEBSOCKET COMPLEXITY
   Managing WebSocket state across multiple connections and agents is 
   harder than it looks. Centralized registry was essential.

7. FRAMEWORK INTEROP REQUIRES ABSTRACTION
   Bridging Pipecat and LangChain tool formats required thoughtful 
   adapter design. Worth the effort for flexibility.

8. TESTING MATTERS
   Manual testing worked for MVP but automated tests would have caught
   regressions and edge cases much faster.

9. CONVERSATION MEMORY IS HARD
   Balancing context retention vs token costs is tricky. Needs more
   sophisticated memory management.

10. USER INTENT IS COMPLEX
    Natural language understanding is challenging. Parameter extraction
    works ~80% of the time, needs improvement for edge cases.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
15. FUTURE ROADMAP
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
